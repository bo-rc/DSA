# What else can DFS do?
We can augment the DFS algorithm to:
- find connected components
- Compute a graphâ€™s minimum spanning tree.
- Detect and find cycles in a graph.
- Check if a graph is bipartite.
- Find strongly connected components.
. Topologically sort the nodes of a graph.
- Find bridges and articulation points.
- Find augmenting paths in a flow network.
- Generate mazes.
